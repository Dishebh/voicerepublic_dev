      explanation:
        offline: >-
          The stage is currently offline. The provisioning window
          opens 90 minutes before a scheduled live stream. Please
          setup your stage as soon as the window opens. This will give
          you enough time to setup your audio signal and contributes
          to smooth operations.

        ready_to_provision: >-
          The provisioning window is now open. The stage is still
          offline. Please start the setup process now.

        provisioning: >-
          We started provisioning a streaming server just for
          you. This will take a couple of minutes. This is a good time
          to grab a coffee or take a walk. We will be right with you.

        ready_to_connect: >-
          Your streaming server is ready now. Please connect with the
          streaming client of your choice. We've a couple of options
          for you.

        connected: >-
          Aye, you're connected!

        disconnected: >-
          Ooops. It appears your stream did disconnect. Please
          reconnect with all the same settings to continue
          streaming. This also means that the recording on our server
          will have gaps. You might want to consider uploading a local
          backup recording afterwards.
