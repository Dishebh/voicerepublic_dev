          <strong> Tip:</strong> If you are streaming from multiple stages, you need to unambiguously identify your streaming sources.
          It will be helpful to give your streaming source a unique name now. If you’re using a Voice Republic Streamboxx, 
          we suggest you write this name on its case.
        app: "<strong> Tip:</strong> The name will help you identify the app you are claiming. Feel free to rename it here."
