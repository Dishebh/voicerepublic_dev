          We were unable to detect any unclaimed clients. If you
          downloaded the Voice Republic Desktop App please make sure
          it's running. If you want to claim a Voice Republic
          Streamboxx please make sure it is connected. Then reload
          this page. If the problem persist please use the alternate
          method below.

          We detected %{count} unclaimed clients connected from your
          network. If you are in control of all these clients, please
          unplug all but one, then reload this page. Otherwise please
          use the alternate method below.

        Alternatively you can always use a pairing code to identifiy
        the client that you want to claim. The pairing code is a four
        digit number. The Voice Republic Desktop App displays the
        pairing code until it is claimed. The Voice Republic
        Streamboxx displays its pairing code on an attached screen as
        well as reads it to you on plugged in headphones.
